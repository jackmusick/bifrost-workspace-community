description: Build Bifrost workflows, forms, and apps. Use when user wants to create, debug, or modify Bifrost artifacts. Supports SDK-first (local dev + git) and MCP-only modes.

# Bifrost Build

Create and debug Bifrost artifacts.

## First: Check Prerequisites

```bash
echo "SDK: $BIFROST_SDK_INSTALLED | Login: $BIFROST_LOGGED_IN | MCP: $BIFROST_MCP_CONFIGURED"
echo "Source: $BIFROST_HAS_SOURCE | Path: $BIFROST_SOURCE_PATH | URL: $BIFROST_DEV_URL"
```

**If SDK or Login is false/empty:** Direct user to run `/bifrost:setup` first.

## Step 1: Download Platform Docs (Once Per Session)

All platform reference (SDK, forms, agents, apps, tables, manifest YAML formats) is in a single document. Fetch it once and grep locally.

**SDK-First:**
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/bifrost-docs
bifrost api GET /api/llms.txt > /tmp/bifrost-docs/llms.txt
```

**MCP-Only:** Call `get_docs` tool, save the result to `/tmp/bifrost-docs/llms.txt`.

Then use `Grep/Read` on `/tmp/bifrost-docs/llms.txt` whenever you need reference.

## Step 2: Detect Development Mode

**Auto-detect:** If a `.bifrost/` directory exists in the workspace, use **SDK-First**. Otherwise, **MCP-Only**. Only ask the user if ambiguous.

## SDK-First Mode

### Principles

- **Discovery goes through the platform.** Use `bifrost <entity> list` and `bifrost <entity> get <ref>` (or the equivalent MCP tools) to discover what exists. The platform's database is the source of truth for entity identity, not local files.
- **`.bifrost/*.yaml` is export-only.** It is what `bifrost sync` / `bifrost export` produce as a versioning / portability artifact. Never read it for discovery and never edit it to mutate entities. Per-UUID `.form.yaml` / `.agent.yaml` files do not exist — form and agent content lives inline in `.bifrost/forms.yaml` and `.bifrost/agents.yaml` keyed by UUID, regenerated from the DB.
- **Write code files locally; mutate entities through the CLI.** Workflow `.py` and app `.tsx` source belongs in the workspace and is synced by `bifrost watch`. Entity records (forms, agents, configs, tables, etc.) are mutated via `bifrost <entity> create | update | delete` — the server assigns the UUID on create.

### Before Building

1. **Which organization?** Ask the user which organization they're building for (natural language — don't dump a list of UUIDs). Confirm the org name, then resolve the UUID with `bifrost orgs get <name> --json` (or `bifrost orgs list --json` and pick from the list).
2. **What triggers this?** (webhook, form, schedule, manual)
3. **If webhook:** Get sample payload from user
4. **What integrations?** `bifrost integrations list --json` — drill into specific ones with `bifrost integrations get <ref> --json`.
5. **If migrating from Rewst:** Use `/rewst-migration` skill
6. **If building something new** (new integration, workflow, app, or shared module — not modifying existing):
   > "It sounds like we're building something new. Would you like me to clone the bifrost-workspace-community repo? It has working examples from the community and might already have what you need."

   If the user agrees:
   ```bash
   if [ -d /tmp/bifrost-community ]; then
     git -C /tmp/bifrost-community pull
   else
     git clone https://github.com/jackmusick/bifrost-workspace-community.git /tmp/bifrost-community
   fi
   ```

   Then use Glob/Grep/Read on `/tmp/bifrost-community` to find relevant examples. Surface what you find and let the user decide:
   - **Reference only** — use as inspiration, write fresh code in their workspace
   - **Port and adapt** — copy relevant files into the workspace and adapt (UUIDs, org references, integration mappings, etc.)

   Only ask once per session. If the user declines, don't ask again.

#### Organization Context for CLI Commands

- **`bifrost run`**: Use `--org <UUID>` to execute in that org's context
- **`bifrost watch`/`sync`**: Files sync based on manifest bindings, not CLI flags — but mutating entity records (forms/agents/etc.) goes through `bifrost <entity> create | update`, which take org refs explicitly
- **`bifrost api`**: Authenticated API client for inspecting platform state (executions, etc.) when no dedicated command exists

### Syncing and Deployment — NEVER Run Without Being Asked

**NEVER run `bifrost watch`, `bifrost sync`, `bifrost push`, or `bifrost git push` unless the user explicitly asks you to.** These commands sync local files to the live platform and can trigger interactive prompts, conflict resolution, or unintended deployments. The agent's job is to write files locally — the user controls when and how they are synced.

Before any build work, check if `bifrost watch` is already running:

```bash
pgrep -f 'bifrost watch' > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "RUNNING" || echo "NOT RUNNING"
```

If not running, tell the user: "Please run `bifrost watch` in a terminal to start syncing." Wait for confirmation before writing files. Once watch is running, the agent writes files locally and watch auto-pushes them.

### Discovery: Query the Platform

| To find... | Command |
|---|---|
| Workflows / tools / data providers | `bifrost workflows list --json` (`bifrost workflows get <ref> --json` for one) |
| Forms | `bifrost forms list --json` / `bifrost forms get <ref> --json` |
| Agents | `bifrost agents list --json` / `bifrost agents get <ref> --json` |
| Apps | `bifrost apps list --json` / `bifrost apps get <ref> --json` |
| Organizations | `bifrost orgs list --json` / `bifrost orgs get <ref> --json` |
| Roles | `bifrost roles list --json` / `bifrost roles get <ref> --json` |
| Integrations | `bifrost integrations list --json` / `bifrost integrations get <ref> --json` |
| Tables | `bifrost tables list --json` / `bifrost tables get <ref> --json` |
| Configs | `bifrost configs list --json` / `bifrost configs get <ref> --json` |
| Event sources | `bifrost events list-sources --json` / `bifrost events get-source <ref> --json` |
| Event subscriptions | `bifrost events list-subscriptions <source-ref> --json` |

For anything without a dedicated command, fall back to `bifrost api GET <path>` — the authenticated REST passthrough. **Do not read `.bifrost/*.yaml` for discovery — it is an export artifact, not the source of truth.**

For YAML field formats and DTO schemas, grep `/tmp/bifrost-docs/llms.txt` for `WorkflowUpdateRequest`, `FormCreate`, etc. Every CLI verb's full flag list is also available via `bifrost <entity> <verb> --help` (generated from the DTOs so it is always in sync).

### Creation Flow

1. **Pick the right surface for what you're creating:**
   - **Code entities** (workflow `.py`, app `.tsx`): write the file in the workspace; let `bifrost watch` sync it; then for workflows run `bifrost workflows register --path workflows/foo.py --function-name foo` to index the decorated function (the server assigns the UUID and returns it).
   - **Renaming or moving a workflow:** Do NOT re-register after a rename/move — that mints a new UUID and breaks form/agent references. Instead: write the new file, then `bifrost workflows replace <old-uuid> --path <new-path> --function-name <new-func>`. Find the orphaned UUID first with `bifrost workflows list-orphaned --json` if needed.
   - **Content entities** (forms, agents, integrations, tables, configs, event sources, roles, orgs): use the entity's `create` command — `bifrost <entity> create --name foo ...`. The server assigns the UUID and returns it. File-loaded fields (form schemas, agent system prompts, etc.) accept `@path/to/file` syntax (e.g. `--system-prompt @prompt.md`, `--form-schema @schema.yaml`, `--config-schema @schema.yaml`).
2. **Capture the returned UUID** from the create command's JSON output if anything else needs to reference it (forms reference workflows, agents reference tools, etc.). Cross-references can also be portable refs (`name`, `path::func`, slug) — the CLI resolves them at submit time.
3. **Verify by re-querying:** `bifrost <entity> get <uuid>` (or by name) confirms the platform sees what you intended.
4. **For discovery of what already exists:** `bifrost <entity> list` / `bifrost <entity> get <ref>` — never read `.bifrost/*.yaml`.

### MCP Tool Naming Convention (CRITICAL for Discoverability)

When workflows are exposed as MCP tools (via agents), their `name` field becomes the MCP tool name and `description` becomes the MCP tool description. Claude.ai uses a deferred tool search system where tools compete on relevance ranking across ALL connected MCP servers. Generic names like `list_findings` or `review_runs` get buried by other servers' tools.

**Tool name format:** `{context}_{action}` — prefix every tool name with a distinctive context word from the agent/feature domain.

**Tool description format:** Must include the agent/feature name and enough distinctive vocabulary to win search ranking. Lead with what it does, include the domain context.

Example — Agent Tuning tools:

| Bad name | Good name | Bad description | Good description |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| `list_findings` | `list_agent_tuning_findings` | "List findings with filtering" | "List agent tuning findings from Bifrost AI agent run reviews with filtering and pagination" |
| `review_agent_runs` | `review_agent_tuning_runs` | "Review an agent's recent runs" | "Review a Bifrost AI agent's recent conversation runs and create tuning findings for prompt issues" |
| `dry_run_prompt` | `dry_run_agent_tuning_prompt` | "Test a candidate prompt" | "Generate a candidate prompt from confirmed agent tuning findings and dry-run test it against historical runs" |

**Rules:**
1. Every tool name MUST contain a context prefix that identifies its agent/feature (e.g. `agent_tuning_`, `halopsa_`, `documentation_`)
2. The `description` field MUST mention the agent or feature name — this is what `tool_search` ranks on
3. Descriptions should be self-contained — someone seeing ONLY the description (no server name) should know what domain this tool belongs to
4. Follow the convention used by professional MCP servers: `microsoft_docs_search`, `outlook_email_search`, `execute_halopsa_sql`

### CLI Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `bifrost watch` | Primary dev command — starts interactive watch session, syncs file changes on save |
| `bifrost sync` | One-shot bidirectional sync — **interactive TUI, user must run manually** |
| `bifrost run <file> -w <name> --org <UUID>` | Execute workflow in specific org context |
| `bifrost api <METHOD> <path>` | Bifrost platform API client ONLY — inspect executions, validate apps, check platform state. NOT for third-party APIs. |
| `bifrost push` | One-shot upload — **interactive TUI, user must run manually** |
| `bifrost pull` | One-shot download — **interactive TUI, user must run manually** |
| `bifrost <entity> list \| get \| create \| update \| delete` | Discover and mutate entity records (orgs, roles, workflows, forms, agents, apps, integrations, tables, configs, events). Server assigns the UUID on create. Flag list per verb: `bifrost <entity> <verb> --help` (generated from the DTO, always in sync). |
| `bifrost workflows register --path workflows/foo.py --function-name foo` | Register a decorated workflow function from a `.py` file that `bifrost watch` has already synced. |
| `bifrost workflows list-orphaned` | List workflows whose source file was deleted or function renamed without using `replace`. These are invisible to `bifrost workflows list`. |
| `bifrost workflows replace <uuid> --path <new-path> --function-name <new-func>` | Repoint an orphaned workflow UUID to a new file location. UUID is preserved — form/agent/app references stay intact. File must exist and contain the named decorated function. |
| `bifrost migrate-imports` | Rewrite `import from "bifrost"` statements to use `lucide-react` / `react-router-dom` / relative paths. **Always review the diff** before applying — the classifier uses regex, not AST, so a local binding that shadows a platform name can be misclassified. |

### Platform Operations

| Need | Command |
|------|---------|
| Run a workflow | `bifrost run <file> -w <name> --org <UUID> --params '{...}'` |
| Run a workflow (remote) | `bifrost api POST /api/workflows/{id}/execute '{"workflow_id":"...","input_data":{...},"sync":true}'` |
| Check execution logs | `bifrost api GET /api/executions/{id}` |
| List executions | `bifrost api GET /api/executions` |
| List workflows / discover by id | `bifrost workflows list --json` / `bifrost workflows get <ref> --json` |
| Validate an app | `bifrost api POST /api/applications/{id}/validate` |
| Download platform docs | `bifrost api GET /api/llms.txt > /tmp/bifrost-docs/llms.txt` |

### `bifrost api` Boundaries (CRITICAL)

`bifrost api` is ONLY for the Bifrost platform API. It does NOT proxy to third-party integration APIs. Prefer the dedicated `bifrost <entity> ...` verbs whenever one exists; `bifrost api` is the escape hatch for endpoints not yet wrapped by a verb.

- **Valid**: `/api/executions/{id}`, `/api/workflows`, `/api/applications/{id}/validate`, `/api/llms.txt`
- **Invalid**: `/Client/237` (HaloPSA), `/companies` (Pax8), or any non-`/api/` path

**If you don't know whether an endpoint exists, check first:**
1. Download the docs if not already cached: `bifrost api GET /api/llms.txt > /tmp/bifrost-docs/llms.txt`
2. Grep for the endpoint: `grep -i "endpoint_name" /tmp/bifrost-docs/llms.txt`
3. If it's not documented, it doesn't exist — do NOT guess URL patterns

**To call a third-party integration API** (HaloPSA, Pax8, NinjaOne, etc.):
- Write a small test workflow using the SDK module and run it with `bifrost run`
- Never try to route integration API calls through `bifrost api`

### MCP Tools (creation and events only)

| Need | Tool |
|------|------|
| Create a form | `create_form` |
| Create an app | `create_app` |
| Create an agent | `create_agent` |
| Event triggers | `create_event_source`, `create_event_subscription` |
| RAG search | `search_knowledge` |
| Validate an app | `validate_app` or `bifrost api POST /api/applications/{id}/validate` |
| App dependencies | `get_app_dependencies`, `update_app_dependencies` |

### Syncing

**`bifrost watch` handles file syncing.** Entity records (forms, agents, etc.) are NOT synced via watch — they are mutated through `bifrost <entity> create | update | delete`. The agent NEVER runs sync commands (`bifrost sync` / `push` / `pull`) directly.

#### NEVER run these commands from the agent (CRITICAL)

`bifrost sync`, `bifrost push`, and `bifrost pull` all launch an **interactive TUI** for conflict resolution. They will hang or fail when run non-interactively. The agent must NEVER execute these commands.

#### Sync rules

1. **Before writing any code files**, verify `bifrost watch` is running:
   ```bash
   pgrep -f 'bifrost watch' > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "RUNNING" || echo "NOT RUNNING"
   ```
2. **If watch is running**: Write code files locally. Watch syncs file changes. For new entity records, run `bifrost <entity> create ...` — do NOT add `.bifrost/*.yaml` entries by hand.
3. **If watch is NOT running**: Tell the user: "Please run `bifrost watch` in a terminal first." **Do NOT write files until the user confirms watch is running.**
4. **If the user asks to sync manually** (push/pull/sync): Tell them to run the command themselves in their terminal since it requires interactive TUI input.
5. **`bifrost git push`** is for git-integrated deployments. Only mention it when the user explicitly asks about git deployment — and they must run it themselves.

#### What about deploying without watch?

If the user doesn't want to run watch and asks to deploy, tell them to run `bifrost sync` or `bifrost push` in their own terminal. The agent cannot do this for them.

Preflight (runs automatically in watch): manifest YAML, file existence, Python syntax, ruff linting, UUID cross-references, orphan detection.

### Git Source Control

When the user needs to deploy via git (not watch mode), use the `bifrost git` subcommands:

```bash
bifrost git fetch                     # regenerate manifest from DB, fetch remote
bifrost git status                    # show changed files, ahead/behind
bifrost git commit -m "description"   # regenerate manifest, stage, preflight, commit
bifrost git push                      # pull + push + import entities (deploy)
git pull                              # pull platform commits into local repo
bifrost git resolve path=keep_remote  # resolve merge conflicts
bifrost git diff <path>               # show file diff
bifrost git discard <path>            # discard working tree changes
```

Typical workflow: `bifrost git fetch` -> `bifrost git commit -m "msg"` -> `bifrost git push` -> `git pull` (to get the platform's commits locally).

## MCP-Only Mode

Best for: quick iterations, non-developers, no local git repo.

1. Call `get_docs` to get platform reference
2. Use `list_workflows`, `list_integrations`, etc. for discovery
3. Write via `replace_content`, register with `register_workflow`. For forms/apps: `create_form`, `create_app`.
4. Test via `execute_workflow` or preview URL
5. Check logs via `get_execution`
6. Iterate with `patch_content` / `replace_content`

Prefer `patch_content` for surgical edits. Use `replace_content` for full file rewrites.

## Building Apps

### Design Workflow

Before writing any app code, design what you're building.

**New app:**
1. Ask: "What should this app feel like? Any products you'd like it inspired by?"
2. If a product is named, **describe the specific visual patterns** that define it — not abstract qualities ("clean", "modern") but concrete observations: "full-height dark sidebar with icon+label nav items, content area with a sticky toolbar row above the main editor, right panel for live preview with a simulated email client frame, generous whitespace between sections, muted borders instead of heavy dividers."
3. Write a visual spec for each key screen: what elements exist, their spatial relationships, which are fixed vs. scrollable, where the visual weight sits, how the eye flows. This is the design — get it right before writing code.
4. Plan `styles.css` for visual identity — color palette, typography scale, spacing rhythm, dark mode variants.
5. Decide what's a custom component vs. pre-included shadcn. shadcn is for standard interactions (settings forms, confirmation dialogs, data tables). Custom components are for the interactions that define the app's identity — a project management app needs a custom kanban board, not a `<Table>`; an email tool needs a simulated inbox, not a textarea in a split pane.
6. Then start building.

**Existing app:**
1. Read existing `styles.css` and `components/` first
2. Match established design patterns

### Critical App Rules

1. **Every `<PascalCase>` tag and identifier needs an explicit import.** There is no auto-injection. See [import-patterns.md](import-patterns.md) for which name comes from which source.
2. **Root layout:** `_layout.tsx` uses `<Outlet />` from `"bifrost"` (or `"react-router-dom"`) — NOT `{children}`.
3. **Workflow hooks:** Always use UUIDs, never names — `useWorkflowQuery("uuid-here")`. Resolve UUIDs with `bifrost workflows list --json` or `bifrost workflows get <ref> --json`.
4. **Fixed-height container:** Your app renders in a fixed-height box — manage your own scrolling (see [app-patterns.md](app-patterns.md) "Custom components" for layout patterns).
5. **Custom CSS:** `styles.css` at app root, dark mode via `.dark` selector.
6. **Dependencies:** Declare npm packages in `app.yaml` (max 20, loaded from esm.sh at runtime — no `package.json` required).
7. **Default exports:** Every page file MUST have a default export. Components under `components/` may be default or named; the bundler detects which.
8. **Migrating an older app:** run `bifrost migrate-imports` from the workspace root, then **review the diff** before applying. See [import-patterns.md](import-patterns.md) "Migration notes".

### App Resilience Rules (MANDATORY)

These patterns are required for every data-fetching page. Full code examples in [app-patterns.md](app-patterns.md).

- Handle `isLoading` / `isError` on every `useWorkflowQuery`.
- Null-safe access: `data?.items?.map(...)`, never `data.items.map(...)`.
- Every `useWorkflowMutation` must handle errors (toast + stay on page).
- Verify `useEffect` dep arrays — no stale closures.
- Custom components go in `components/<Name>.tsx`, imported relatively.
- Heavy routes: split with `React.lazy(() => import("./pages/heavy"))` + `<Suspense>`.

### Platform API Reference

Every name exported by the `"bifrost"` package is listed in [platform-api.md](platform-api.md) with signature and usage example. The canonical list lives in `api/bifrost/platform_names.py` (`PLATFORM_EXPORT_NAMES`) and a drift test enforces docs match the set.

Common lookups:
- **`useWorkflowQuery` / `useWorkflowMutation`** — [platform-api.md](platform-api.md) § Hooks
- **`useUser` / `useAppState` / `RequireRole`** — [platform-api.md](platform-api.md) § Hooks
- **UI primitives (Button, Card, Dialog, Table, etc.)** — [platform-api.md](platform-api.md) § UI Components
- **`toast` / `cn` / `format*`** — [platform-api.md](platform-api.md) § Utilities
- **React Router (Link, useNavigate, etc.)** — [platform-api.md](platform-api.md) § React Router

### App Workflow (SDK-First)

1. Write files in `apps/{slug}/`
2. Create the app record: `bifrost apps create --name "My App" --slug my-app [--deps @package.json]` — the server assigns the UUID and returns it. Do NOT hand-edit `.bifrost/apps.yaml`.
3. `bifrost watch` syncs file changes (triggers esbuild rebuild + validation after each push).
4. Preview at `$BIFROST_DEV_URL/apps/{slug}/preview`
5. Fix any validation errors shown in watch output. esbuild errors appear as a banner in the preview and in the diagnostics channel — the last good bundle keeps serving underneath until the error is fixed.

### App Workflow (MCP-Only)

1. `create_app(name="My App")` — scaffolds `_layout.tsx` + `pages/index.tsx`
2. Edit with `patch_content` / `replace_content`
3. Preview at `$BIFROST_DEV_URL/apps/{slug}/preview`
4. Validate with `validate_app(app_id)`

### Post-Build Validation Checklist (REQUIRED)

After writing all app files, verify:

1. `_layout.tsx` exists and uses `<Outlet />`
2. `pages/index.tsx` exists
3. Every npm import matches an entry in `app.yaml` dependencies (see [import-patterns.md](import-patterns.md) "User npm deps"; pre-included packages exempt).
4. Every `useWorkflowQuery`/`useWorkflowMutation` uses a valid UUID returned by `bifrost workflows get <ref>` or visible in `bifrost workflows list --json` — do NOT grep `.bifrost/workflows.yaml`.
5. Every `<PascalCase />` JSX tag and every referenced identifier has a matching import — no auto-injection. Cross-reference against [import-patterns.md](import-patterns.md):
   - Platform names → `"bifrost"`
   - Icons → `"lucide-react"`
   - Router primitives → `"react-router-dom"` (preferred) or `"bifrost"` (still works)
   - User components → relative (`./components/Name`)
6. Run validation: `bifrost api POST /api/applications/{id}/validate` (or MCP `validate_app`)
7. Review validation output — fix ALL errors before telling user it's ready
8. Open preview URL and verify pages render (or instruct user to check)

## Testing

- **Workflows (local):** `bifrost run <file> --workflow <name> --org <UUID> --params '{...}'`
- **Workflows (remote):** `bifrost api POST /api/workflows/{id}/execute '{"workflow_id":"...","input_data":{...},"sync":true}'`
- **Forms:** `$BIFROST_DEV_URL/forms/{form_id}`
- **Apps:** Preview at `$BIFROST_DEV_URL/apps/{slug}/preview`, publish with `publish_app`, live at `$BIFROST_DEV_URL/apps/{slug}`
- **Webhooks:** `curl -X POST $BIFROST_DEV_URL/api/hooks/{source_id} -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{...}'`
- **Logs:** `bifrost api GET /api/executions/{id}`

## Debugging

1. Check execution logs: `bifrost api GET /api/executions/{id}`
2. Check `bifrost watch` output for sync errors
3. Verify platform state: `bifrost workflows list --json` / `bifrost <entity> get <ref> --json` (only if sync divergence suspected)

### When Errors Suggest System Bugs

**If BIFROST_HAS_SOURCE is true:**
> "This appears to be a backend bug ({error description}). I have access to the Bifrost source code at $BIFROST_SOURCE_PATH. Would you like me to debug and fix this on the backend?"

**If BIFROST_HAS_SOURCE is false:**
> "This appears to be a backend bug ({error description}). Please report this to the platform team with these details: {error details}"
